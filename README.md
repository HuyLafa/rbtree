# Red-Black Tree Node Insertion App

**Live demo:** [http://tommikaikkonen.github.io/rbtree/](http://tommikaikkonen.github.io/rbtree/#)

This application helps demonstrate red-black tree node insertion cases. If you want to look at the code, I suggest starting from js/tree.js to see the data structures, moving onto js/treeView.js to see presentation-related data and finally js/ui.js and js/main.js for user interface code and the main program start.

The live application is used on a teaching video produced for an Algorithms & Data Structures class. The video can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9SaX0yeneU).

The application has only been tested on Google Chrome 40 (Mac OS X), may not work correctly on older browsers.
